### TDD Led Driver

This is a Led Driver test developed using TDD. It's based on James W. Grenning's Test-Driven Development for Embedded C Led Driver example.

The only difference is that this test uses ceedling instead on plain unity framework.
Firstly install ceedling and the run `ceedling` to run all the tests.
Ceedling has plenty of documentation around, so be happy! :)
